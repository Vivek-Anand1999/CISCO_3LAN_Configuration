# CISCO_3LAN_Configuration
A Cisco router switch LAN architecture is a network topology that uses a combination of routers and switches to connect devices on a local area network (LAN). Routers are responsible for routing traffic between different networks, while switches are responsible for connecting devices within the same network.
